								<h3> Who I am?</h3>
								<p>I'm a 21 year old computer nerd, born in Karachi, Pakistan. I'm a college student, pursuing Bs Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Science, aka LUMS. Apart from computers, I am an artist at heart, and a firm believer that anything can be art, as long as there was some creative process behind it, be it fine painting, graphic design or even playing a new tune on your dad's rusty acoustic guitar. Oh and I think I forgot to mention, I'm really into cars, to the point that I can tell you whether it was a Mercedes E63s or a BMW M5 Competition that flew by us, just by hearing the sound from it's exhaust. Pretty crazy, right?   </p>
								<h3>My Journey</h3>
								<p>I began my journey at LUMS in 2022, after graduating from The Lyceum School in Karachi, where I completed my Cambridge A levels with stellar grades. Moving to Lahore was an experience in itself, the vibrant city is very hospitable, but poses it's own set of challenges to overcome. Studying Computer Science at LUMS, was very intense, but in the long run it prepared me for harsh work-life balance and continuous effort that are hallmarks of this field. To keep my sanity intact, I picked up an activity; strength training, a hobby; playing guitar and a society; PhotoLUMS. I believe these three things are significant for a good college experience.
                                    My journey with PhotoLUMS allowed me to develop new skills and gain valuable experience in managing a team and events, as well as helping me build strong connections.</p>
                                <p>Fast forward to summers, I started my first internship at Dubai Islamic Bank, where I helped with projects primarily focused on upscaling and modernization of the Bankâ€™s digital delivery channels through AI enablement. Following that I joined Headstarter AI as a SWE fellow, where I wokred on more innovative projects that honed my skills and equipped me with the expertise to tackle problems using impactful solutions. With that I'm looking forward to working with more top-tier companies to innovate in sustainable technology. </p>
								<h3>My Vision</h3>
                                <p>My vision is to leverage AI and machine learning to introduce sustainable technologies that address real-world issues and improve lives globally. By predicting environmental trends and optimizing resource usage, AI can tackle climate change and reduce carbon footprints. In healthcare, it can revolutionize diagnostics, enable personalized treatment plans, and enhance service efficiency. Working with top-tier companies and experts, I aim to learn from their innovative approaches to create impactful solutions. AI can optimize agriculture through precision farming, improve energy management, address water scarcity, enhance education with personalized learning platforms, reduce traffic congestion and emissions, support telemedicine for remote healthcare access, and provide farmers with insights into crop management and soil health, thereby promoting sustainability and improving quality of life worldwide.</p>
